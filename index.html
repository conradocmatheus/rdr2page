            Red Dead Redemption 2 is a prequel that tells the story of Arthur
            Morgan, a member of the Van der Linde gang, as they navigate the
            rugged landscapes of America's heartland in 1899. Fleeing from the
            law after a failed robbery, the gang struggles to survive while

            opportunities in a changing world. As Arthur, players witness his
            journey of loyalty, redemption, and self-discovery, making choices
            that shape his fate and the fate of those around him in this epic
            tale set against the backdrop of the fading Wild West.
